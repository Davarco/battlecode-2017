I know this is a little late into the competition, but I decided I should keep track of stuff.

TODO:
- Implement alternate priority with scouts!
- Lower number of scouts
- Improve tree and robot creation locations? (Should have been fixed ago)
- Better tree chopping choices for lumberjacks
- If possible, have smarter pathing (A*, bug pathing)
