So, I just challenged some of the top teams. Pretty good confidence booster, doing well atm.

However, they exploited some pretty glaring weaknesses. These need to be implemented ASAP if I am to advance.

- Prone to yolo rushes...
    - Gardener picks to build robot in bad direction
    - Robot:Tree ratio is too high in the beginning

- Gardeners pick a bad spot to build a lot of the time
    - Maybe try bounce code for better area searching?

- Gardeners get killed early on
    - Implement SOS code?
    - Robots run away too early, need to use more stationary movement?

- Robots are suicidal
    - Probably add some outmatched function, don't attack groups of robots by self

I have to say, this has been a really fun time. I know later I might be disappointed, but hopefully I will remember this moment.
