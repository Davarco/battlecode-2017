Battlecode Submission 2017 - NoException
========================================

I've decided to open-source my MIT Battlecode submission as it is post-contest. Hopefully this bot helps other players in future tournaments, especially those who are new and have struggled for a while like I did. 

This submission advanced to the top 12 of the high school division, and also did respectably in the seeding and qualifying tournament. To understand how to run the bot and how the game works, please refer to Battlecode's official website.
