# Battlecode Submission 2017 - NoException

I've decided to open-source my MIT Battlecode submission as it is post-contest. Hopefully this bot helps other players in future tournaments, especially those who are new and have struggled for a while like I did. 

To understand how to run the bot and how the game works, please refer to Battlecode's official website.
